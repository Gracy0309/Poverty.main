    <h3 style="color: #000000; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 150px; margin-right: 150px;">
        11 Top Causes of Global Poverty:<br>
        <li>1. INEQUALITY AND MARGINALIZATION  </li>
        <li>2. CONFLICT </li>
        <li>3. HUNGER, MALNUTRITION, AND STUNTING</li>
        <li>4. POOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS — ESPECIALLY FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN</li>
        <li>5. LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE</li>
        <li>6. CLIMATE CHANGE</li>
        <li>7. LACK OF EDUCATION</li>
        <li>8. POOR PUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE</li>
        <li>9. LACK OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT</li>
        <li>10.LACK OF JOBS OR LIVELIHOODS</li>
        <li>11.LACK OF RESERVES</li><br>
        
        
        <ul>1. INEQUALITY AND MARGINALIZATION<br> 
            Inequality is a term used to describe the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from having a voice or representation in decision-making. Gender inequality, caste systems, marginalization based on race or tribal affiliations are all economic and social inequalities that can lead to poverty.
        <br>
        <ul> 2. CONFLICT<br>
            Conflict is a major form of risk driving poverty, with large-scale, protracted violence destroying infrastructure and causing people to flee. Small bouts of violence can have huge impacts on communities, particularly on women, who are particularly vulnerable.
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>3. HUNGER, MALNUTRITION, AND STUNTING<br>
            Poverty is caused by hunger and malnutrition, and the first 1,000 days of a child's life are key to their future health and likelihood of staying out of poverty. Child stunting can lead to a lifetime of impacts, with adults earning 22% less than those who weren't stunted.
        </ul>
        <br>
        <ul>4. POOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS — ESPECIALLY FOR MOTHERS AND CHILDREN<br>
            Pregnancy and childbirth can be a death sentence in many countries due to lack of access to quality maternal healthcare, especially for adolescent girls aged 18 and under.</ul>
        
    
        <ul>5. LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE<br>
            Currently, more than 2 billion people don’t have access to clean water at home. This means that people (which is to say, women and girls) collectively spend some 200 million hours every day walking long distances to fetch water. That’s precious time that could be used working, or getting an education to help secure a job later in life.

            Contaminated water can also lead to a host of waterborne diseases, ranging from the chronic to the life-threatening. Poor water infrastructure — such as sanitation and hygiene facilities — can compound this, or create other barriers to escaping poverty, such as keeping girls out of school during menstruation.</ul>

        <ul>6. CLIMATE CHANGE<br>
            Climate change creates hunger, whether through too little water (drought) or too much (flooding), and its effects contribute to the cycle of poverty in several other ways including disproportionately affecting women, creating refugees, and even influencing conflict. One World Bank estimates that climate change has the power to push more than 100 million people into poverty over the next decade.

            Many of the world’s poorest populations rely on farming or hunting and gathering to eat and earn a living — for example, Malawi is 80% agrarian. They often have only just enough food and assets to last through the next season, and not enough reserves to fall back on in the event of a poor harvest. So when climate change or natural disasters (including the widespread droughts caused by El Niño) leave millions of people without food, it pushes them further into poverty, and can make recovery even more difficult.
            
            </ul>

        <ul>7. LACK OF EDUCATION<br>
            Not every person without an education is living in extreme poverty. But most of the extremely poor don’t have an education. There are many barriers to education around the world, including a lack of money for uniforms and books, a bias against girls’ education, or many of the other causes of poverty mentioned here.

            but education is often referred to as the great equalizer, because it can open the door to jobs and other resources and skills that a family needs to not just survive, but thrive. UNESCO estimates that 171 million people could be lifted out of extreme poverty if they left school with basic reading skills. Poverty threatens education, but education can also help end poverty.
        </ul>

        <ul>8. POOR PUBLIC WORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE<br>
            Imagine that you have to go to work, but there are no roads to get you there. Or heavy rains have flooded your route and made it impossible to travel. A lack of infrastructure — from roads, bridges, and wells, to cables for light, cell phones, and internet — can isolate communities living in rural areas. Living off the grid often means living without the ability to go to school, work, or the market to buy and sell goods. Traveling further distances to access basic services not only takes time, it costs money, keeping families in poverty.
            Isolation limits opportunity. Without opportunity, many find it difficult, if not impossible, to escape extreme poverty.
        </ul>

        <ul>9. LACK OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT<br>
            Many people living in the United States are familiar with social welfare programs that people can access if they need healthcare or food assistance. But not every government can provide this type of help to its citizens — and without that safety net, there’s nothing to stop vulnerable families from backsliding further into extreme poverty. Ineffective governments also contribute to several of the other causes of extreme poverty mentioned above, as they are unable to provide necessary infrastructure or healthcare, or ensure the safety and security of their citizens in the event of conflict.
        </ul>

        <ul>10. LACK OF JOBS OR LIVELIHOODS<br>
            This might seem like a no-brainer: Without a job or a livelihood, people will face poverty. Dwindling access to productive land (often due to conflict, overpopulation, or climate change) and overexploitation of resources like fish or minerals puts increasing pressure on many traditional livelihoods. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for example, most of the population lives in rural communities where natural resources have been plundered over centuries of colonial rule — while conflict over land has forced people away from their source of income and food. Now, more than half of the country lives in extreme poverty.

        </ul>

        <ul>11. LACK OF RESERVES<br>
            All of the above risk factors — from conflict to climate change or even a family illness — can be weathered if a family or community has reserves in place. Cash savings and loans can offset unemployment due to conflict or illness. Proper food storage systems can help if a drought or natural disaster ruins a harvest.

            People living in extreme poverty usually don’t have these means available. This means that, when a risk turns into a disaster, they turn to negative coping mechanisms, including pulling children out of school to work (or even marry), and selling off assets to buy food. That can help a family make it through one bad season, but not another. For communities constantly facing climate extremes or prolonged conflict, the repeated shocks can send a family reeling into extreme poverty and prevent them from ever recovering.
